## Hi!
Recently, an idea came to me: why not make a bot that will warn me about the emotional coloring of the audio message? 
I often wanted to have this thingðŸ˜…

To implement this idea, we will need to turn an audio message into text,
then train a neural network that will determine 
whether the message is positive or not(so that we can say that we don't have headphones or come up with another excuse),
and then embed it all into the chat bot
